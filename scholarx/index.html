A few batchmates were already volunteering at SEF and their exposure and experience were really outstanding. In my second year of undergraduate life, I was privileged to become the chief coordinator of hackX 2019 Inter-University Startup Challenge, one of the most popular startup pre-accelerator in Sri Lanka organized by the University of Kelaniya.

As mentioned above it’s an Industrial Mentoring program, which creates an invaluable platform for undergraduates to get mentored by giant brains (and to mentor one day) in the industry, get to know them, expose to their experience, support &amp; guidance towards the success.</p><p>I heard about ScholarX when it was first launched in 2019, A colleague of mine, had the opportunity to get selected to ScholarX class of 2019, and his experience throughout the program gave me the motivation to apply for this valuable opportunity.

Entrepreneurship was the major topic we discussed as his thoughts were priceless for a newbie to the Startup eco-system like me. He guided me on how to survive in the startup eco-system, being a blooming startup, how to face challenges, how to understand key concerns and apply them towards success.</p><p>There is no short path for anything, especially if it’s a startup. Being only a hard worker also not going to lead you up to the peak. You should understand the market requirement and <strong><strong>build the right thing</strong></strong>. You should be smart, a good planner as well as a forecaster. Opportunities don’t come following us. You should seek for opportunities, take opportunities, and drive your startup towards success. Understanding the groundwork, the fundamentals, and the basics will be a good foundation for a solid, stable future.<br>Especially for a startup, having the right business model, market fit, and a well-organized execution plan will be the key concerns of success.</p><p>These are only a few key aspects that I have learned from Mr. Ganindu. There is a lot more to share with you. I strongly believe the guidance &amp; Support I receive would help you to fulfill your life goals. If you are an entrepreneur, a thinker out of the box, the upcoming blog articles I’m planning to write including the discussions about the Entrepreneurship &amp; Startups, with Mr. Ganindu, would be really helpful for you. So I‘m planning to share the experience as well as the valuable knowledge &amp; guidance I receive through the ScholarX program with you all through upcoming blog articles.</p><h3 id="important-become-a-scholarx-mentee-next-time-">Important: Become a ScholarX mentee next time!</h3><p>Now you have read my experience &amp; thoughts in the ScholarX program. I’m still a newbie to the program, and I was able to learn a lot within the past couple of weeks. So If you are an undergraduate reading this, I highly recommend you give this opportunity a try next time.</p><p>ScholarX will take you towards the success day by day! Keep in touch with the Sustainable Education Foundation Official web site &amp; the Facebook page for future updates. I wish all of you will be able to have this amazing opportunity which I’m experiencing today!</p><p>Have a Nice Day!</p>
