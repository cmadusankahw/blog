SEF has launched a number of programs to support the Sri Lankan Educational Community starting from school students to postgraduates and researchers.</p><p>As an undergraduate at the University of Kelaniya, It was my fortune to hear about SEF and their valuable programs and I had a keen interest in joining &amp; volunteering. A few batchmates were already volunteering at SEF and their exposure and experience were really outstanding. In my second year of undergraduate life, I was privileged to become the chief coordinator of hackX 2019 Inter-University Startup Challenge, one of the most popular startup pre-accelerator in Sri Lanka organized by the University of Kelaniya. There I had a valuable opportunity to work with SEF, get their exposure &amp; experience to drive the event through success.</p><h3 id="the-scholarx">The ScholarX</h3><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2020/07/image.png" class="kg-image" alt="ScholarX | Mentorship towards success" width="1280" height="720" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/image.png 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/image.png 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2020/07/image.png 1280w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>ScholarX by SEF</figcaption></figure><blockquote><em><em>ScholarX, one of four flagship programs coordinated and executed by the Sustainable Education Foundation, provides a mentorship platform for undergraduate students in Sri Lanka.

As mentioned above it’s an Industrial Mentoring program, which creates an invaluable platform for undergraduates to get mentored by giant brains (and to mentor one day) in the industry, get to know them, expose to their experience, support &amp; guidance towards the success.</p><p>I heard about ScholarX when it was first launched in 2019, A colleague of mine, had the opportunity to get selected to ScholarX class of 2019, and his experience throughout the program gave me the motivation to apply for this valuable opportunity. Today I was lucky enough to become a ScholarX mentee for class 2020, as one of the greatest achievements in my life.</p><h3 id="why-scholarx">Why ScholarX?</h3><p>If you are planning to have a good mentorship, industrial guidance &amp; support for your undergraduate life, projects, or academic researches and to contribute back to the community, ScholarX is the best opportunity for you.</p><p>ScholarX consist of a rich pool of mentors from various industries, researchers, winners all over the world.

If you understand the fundementals, then it’s easy to build things.</em></em><br><br><em><em>— Ganindu Nanayakkara</em></em></blockquote><h3 id="the-discussions-">The Discussions...</h3><p>For the past few weeks, I had two mentoring sessions with Mr. Ganindu Nanayakkara, where I learned a lot. Since the first day, he encouraged me to ask more and more questions while expressing his thoughts and experience with his broad knowledge. Entrepreneurship was the major topic we discussed as his thoughts were priceless for a newbie to the Startup eco-system like me. He guided me on how to survive in the startup eco-system, being a blooming startup, how to face challenges, how to understand key concerns and apply them towards success.</p><p>There is no short path for anything, especially if it’s a startup. Being only a hard worker also not going to lead you up to the peak. You should understand the market requirement and <strong><strong>build the right thing</strong></strong>. You should be smart, a good planner as well as a forecaster. Opportunities don’t come following us. You should seek for opportunities, take opportunities, and drive your startup towards success. Understanding the groundwork, the fundamentals, and the basics will be a good foundation for a solid, stable future.<br>Especially for a startup, having the right business model, market fit, and a well-organized execution plan will be the key concerns of success.</p><p>These are only a few key aspects that I have learned from Mr. Ganindu. There is a lot more to share with you. I strongly believe the guidance &amp; Support I receive would help you to fulfill your life goals. If you are an entrepreneur, a thinker out of the box, the upcoming blog articles I’m planning to write including the discussions about the Entrepreneurship &amp; Startups, with Mr. Ganindu, would be really helpful for you. So I‘m planning to share the experience as well as the valuable knowledge &amp; guidance I receive through the ScholarX program with you all through upcoming blog articles.</p><h3 id="important-become-a-scholarx-mentee-next-time-">Important: Become a ScholarX mentee next time!</h3><p>Now you have read my experience &amp; thoughts in the ScholarX program. I’m still a newbie to the program, and I was able to learn a lot within the past couple of weeks. So If you are an undergraduate reading this, I highly recommend you give this opportunity a try next time.</p><p>ScholarX will take you towards the success day by day! Keep in touch with the Sustainable Education Foundation Official web site &amp; the Facebook page for future updates. I wish all of you will be able to have this amazing opportunity which I’m experiencing today!</p><p>Have a Nice Day!</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Jump into Blogging!

So the first idea comes to your mind should be , Writing a Technical Blog!</p><p>But today, most of us find it's difficult to write a blog specially when you are a beginner, not to write, but to create and manage your blog Actually. Thinking of a general CMS (Content Management System) like WordPress, Jumla, It's not that easy to configure, write and publish your blogs, specially when it comes to technical blogs, as most of your requirements , you may need to satisfy manually and may need to depend on a 3rd party plugins full of adds, malware etc..</p><p><strong>Ghost, is a</strong> <strong>powerful CMS (Headless), based on NodeJs (JavaScript) </strong>which is specially built for developers like you &amp; me.. It can be easily aligned with <strong>GitHub Pages, </strong>which I'm gonna explain in a minute, and also can be integrated with number of day to day apps we use like slack, trello, google analytics etc.. You can find many tutorials and guides for ghost setup in web.. But I thought to write this as, with recent updates, Ghost Installation and Configuration have been changed and made super easy, and also some Static generator tools and methods introduced in those tutorials seems broken or not properly working now!</p><p>So without further Ado, I'll quickly take you through, How I create this amazing Blog with Ghost, wget &amp; GitHub Pages within minutes... Believe me, It's super easy!! And you do not need a coding knowledge at all!</p><hr><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2020/06/image.png" class="kg-image" alt="Jump into Blogging!

Now we are ready with out stunning blog site, built locally. Now It's time to publish your blog on GitHub. </p><p>For that we need a GitHub Repository with <strong>GitHub Pages (gh-pages)</strong> enabled. </p><p>For your GitHub account, you already have a by default GitHub Pages enabled repository, which can be used as your Home page/ site on GitHub Pages. If you have not yet created it, you can create it by simply adding a new repository with below naming convention.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p><strong><code>yourUserName.github.io</code></strong></p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>You can commit any static HTML,CSS,JS files to that repository and GitHub will host the for free for us, with<strong> SSL enabled!</strong> Sounds Great! Right?</p><p>So I'm not recommending you to put your blog in this repository. You can use this  repository to showcase some important content, as this is your home page ( not just one page, you can include a complete static site there with navigation). For me, as an example, I included my Online Resume there. You can have a look at it by visiting my GiHub Pages Home..</p><p><code>https://cmadusankahw.github.io</code></p><p>So let's create a new repository! I'm going to rename it as blog , so then you can access it on web as follows.</p><p><code>https://yourUserName.github.io/blog</code></p><p>(Note:- You can use any name you want.Once GitHub pages are enabled, you can simply access them in web as <strong>yourUserName.github.io/repositoryName</strong> )</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2020/06/image-4.png" class="kg-image" alt="Jump into Blogging!

To do that, got to the directory where you have installed ghost ( You can do this in any Directory, here I'm using the same folder where Ghost installed. It's up to you!) and open a new <strong>Terminal Window</strong> there.</p><p>Execute below command to create a local repository for your blog.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p><code>git clone https://github.com/yourUserName/blog.git</code></p>

But the content need to be static. That means you cannot put any PHP , NodeJS or whatever dynamic stuff there. they won't work!</p><p>So to generate our blog into Static site, we use a powerful, less-error tool called <strong>wget</strong>, which is shipped along with Ubuntu Distro ( If not you can install it with<strong> apt-get </strong>easily)</p><p>Assuming your repository name is <strong>blog</strong>, you can execute below command in the same Terminal Window opened inside your ghost installation ( or any other directory you have chosen in the previous step ).</p><p>Whenever you add new blog posts, do modifications locally, You have to execute the same command before commiting changes, to generate your whatever modified content to static site!</p><p><code>wget -r -nH -P blog -E -T 2 -np -k <a href="/">http://localhost:2368/</a></code></p><p>(Note:- If you have created a directory with another name, replace <strong>blog</strong> with your path to directory in the above command)</p><hr><h3 id="wrapping-up-">Wrapping up...</h3><p>Then the usual stuff! Let's commit our static blog into GitHub! to do that, navigate to <strong>blog</strong> Directory in your Terminal and execute following commands.</p><p>Navigate to <strong>blog</strong> directory:</p><p><code>cd blog</code></p><p>To commit your changes:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p><code>git add .</code></p>
<p><code>git commit -m &quot;updating blog&quot;</code></p>
<p><code>git push origin gh-pages</code></p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>That's it! you have all the above commands this this section to update your blog whenever you have added new post, or modified something!</p><p>(Note: When running above commands, If it says that no branch named gh-pages, simply run below command to create a new branch and then execute above 3 commands again)</p><p><strong>Note: Optional. If there is no-branch error only</strong></p><p><code>git branch gh-pages</code></p><p><code>git checkout gh-pages</code></p><p>Great!! That's it! Now within a couple of seconds you can navigate to your Blog!</p><p>For mine, it's</p><p><code>https://cmadusankahw.github.io/blog</code></p><p>What's yours?? :)</p><p>Thanks for reading!
